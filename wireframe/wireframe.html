                WHY I CHOSE TO DESIGN MY WEBSITE IN THIS WAY:

                    My colour palette is essentially broken down to roughly five bright colours of oranges, blues and purples; however these colours are used sparingly as I do not want to overwhelm the viewer and make my website somewhat amateur. In order to do this I have also made use of browns and a dark, almost black/green to neutralize my website somewhat. I have chosen these bright colours as this is an artistic page and I would like to emphasize the creative and fun nature of the makeup artist as well as to draw in my audience and provide a form of visual stimulation. 
                </P>
                <P class = "SecRightP"><br>Overall my pages are uniform where they make use of parallel lines, and make use of a maximum of 2 columns and two rows; however the structure is not too uniform; this simplicity essentially makes it easy to read and navigate through the website as it leads the eye, thus resulting in a greater sense of user engagement. As seen on the home page, the viewer is introduced through circular images, which breaks from the square and rectangular use of images. Images are also separated by text boxes and sometimes are introduced in the images themselves. The subtle interference in shapes and structure separates the websites structure, preventing it from being overly uniform and somewhat boring. Should the website have consistent side by side imagery and regular, unchanging text formats (as seen on my blog page – not my best work), the reader would not be motivated to read through it.
                </P>
                <P class = "SecRightP"><br>My contact page is simple, without a header and is different from the format of the other pages. The background is unique as it is a blurred out version of the author’s image which is also located next to the text boxes. This page allows for potential clients to contact us directly through the artists email as well as providing their contact information to make them easily reachable for their respective queries, requests and feedback. When the window is made smaller, as does the contact information where it adjusts accordingly to the page size. This makes the page adaptable and easy to use irrespective of what technology is being used.
