                    <P class = "SecRightP"> According to onLi Q’s article, titled: Overview of Data Visualization, she elaborates on and dissects (not surprisingly) on Data Visualization. This being the various illustrations and representations of data via visuals means. This includes and is not limited to: diagrams, charts, trees, tables, scatter plots, maps, waveforms, simulations, volume, pictures etc. This is a sufficient way to embody information in such a way that is more accessible and easily introduced to various individuals due to its easy interpretation. What is particularly helpful with these forms of data representation is the fact that often two different mediums can overlap. This allows for easy interpretation, understanding and analysis even my less skilled individuals within a respective field. Her article equally looks at how our brains in fact interpret visual means of information. This is done via the understandings of pre-attentive processing; this being an individual’s subliminal lodgement of data within one’s surroundings. Her studies however, do not purely look at visual and aesthetic methods of data processing. She elaborates on the lack of involvement within this form of informational processing by its availabilities to the understanding of insight. Despite this, data visualization very clearly reflects on two different ideas; these being its affiliation between aesthetics and serviceableness with regards to the HCI industries.  The aesthetics within HCI has been introduced by Kurosu and Kashimura in 1995; and has been elaborated on and studied comprehensively throughout the years. Their workings provide detailed studies on the significance of well thought out visual representation that is appealing to its viewers. An unappealing form of representation decreases engagement due to a lack of interest. This is a form of virtuosity that has gained interest particularly within the early twenty-first century upon entering a digitally based era. Arguably, as well as through the influence of studies and data, individuals such as Van Wijk have explored how effectiveness within this respective field and informational guidance to be particularly effective; it needs to be sleek, simple, appealing and symmetric.

                        <P class = "SecRightP"> I will be focusing on the respective User Experiences and User Interface with regards to Instagram’s multiplatform application/website. Its interface is simple, sleek and prevents viewers from being overwhelmed by an overly busy screen. This is particularly important when used through a mobile, as features, menus etc. are placed in a smaller and more compact area. In terms of being easily accessible and adaptable for various audiences, it functions very poorly. Even though I have been a consistent user since the year it was released; I often find that I struggle to navigate through various parts of their menus as well as having an easy access to certain features that are consistently released. This is due to the fact that they are trying to be consistent throughout their page with regards to aesthetic appeal through the use of simple icons; however this could be easily combatted y providing a brief tutorial for all new users, as well as by providing a walk through and tutorial whenever a new feature is added. Kidd’s article focuses on various representational outputs; whether through myth, reality, persuasion, visual culture and lastly identity politics. With regards to Instagram, we can view the app as a representation through all of these means. It attempts to create a feel of being able to have an insight into people’s lives, interest, work etc. on a global scale; helping viewers to experience these things through real time such as through live videos. It equally contributes to myth as there is an enormous access to Photoshop as well as camera angles that contribute to creating a certain façade or narrative controlled by the author. Persuasion can be played on through the use of propaganda and also through the creating of aspirational, sometimes unattainable lives or products that may be sold. Visual culture is perhaps the most obvious as there is an abundance to imagery and videos; this is pretty self-explanatory. Lastly, identity politics, this is when a group or people, whether through gender, race, religion etc. are grouped and united by theories of political agendas that they feel oppress them; this can be elaborated on and identified through the abundant sharing of a black fist during the black lives matter movement that represented support for the movement.

                            <P class = "SecRightP"> Data Visualization refers to the depiction of data via visual means. There are various tools that can be used to do this, ranging from and not limited to: diagrams, pictures, charts etc. Jenny Kidd describes data visualization and how it is represented in such a way that allows us to use it within the new eras of mass media. In order to do so she compares it to older, outdated means of representation. She elaborates on the social, political and cultural significances of representation throughout a large area within the artistic and digital industries. Michael Friendly emphasizes how data history is incredibly large in scale and incredibly difficult to summarize to its full extent. Surprisingly, data visualization historically has produced some phenomenal artistic representations, specifically within the 19th century. Due to a sense of beauty in past forms of this medium, it has created a challenge for modern producers, in order to be able to introduce new and innovative approaches, that are just as effective and beautiful, if not more so than those of the past. By understanding this history, one can also understand how and why this particular medium arose.Clive Thompson on the other hand, elaborates on political motives that have been used throughout history and have had a direct impact on entire nations. His work is more specific within this particular field, as opposed to Kidd and Friendly, who have provided a more general understanding of data visualization. This is particularly impactful as it provides access to a larger variety of readers and allows for easier understanding of political motives and results, for example, a graph showing the inequalities of a wage gap varying amongst races and people of different genders.Overall, they have all made it abundantly clear that historical data pays a pivotal role in understanding today’s necessities of data distribution; especially in order to understand and study the most effective means of reaching a larger audience.

                                <P class = "SecRightP"> Knaflic’s literary work revolves around the deep understanding and breaking down of visual modelling. This refers to the graphic representation of various mediums, including and not limited to items and different structures of importance through the use of digital means and dialect. Visual modelling is an appealing, compact and simplified mean of expressing certain information for various individuals; from experiences scholars to beginners within a field.She attempts to distinguish the best methods with which information can be displayed and for which forms of information. This is done with a focus on simplicity as well as aesthetic appeal that is intended to be easily understood by even the most inexperienced of viewers. This is done through the understandings of graph type, as well as the way in which data has been organized. In order to do this, designers need to have an understanding as to how the eye is lead throughout a particular choice of formulated display.She elaborates on the importance of every visual component implemented; from the choice in colour, structure, width, size, borders etcetera. She also elaborated on the importance of headers, footnotes, labels, lists and essentially, how one summarizes the investigated topic. One needs to understand how to in fact shorten a multitude of information that even an individual with very limited digital dialect can understand what is presented from first glance.She also emphasizes the importance of understanding poor forms of visual modelling as this prevents us from making similar mistakes within our own works; specifically when it comes to understanding our audience and why they have come to look at your visual representation of data. That being said, Knaflic emphasizes how there is in fact, no real “right” way of displaying data, this is influenced by the artist’s style, choice and personal understanding of information and data visualization.Overall, Knaflic assists in the identification of both positive and negative choices within the world of data visualization, and how understanding both of these factors are equally important.

                                    <P class = "SecRightP"> I will be analysing the visual representation of the world map on the website Information is beautiful titled COVID-19 Coronavirus Hotspots as displayed below:This particular form of representational strategies within this particular graph is through the use of a world map. Representational strategies refer to how certain form of information is embodied for the viewer or reader. More specifically, this is the kind of information design is transliterated. The communication strategies can refer to how certain information is conveyed. More specifically it is a type of compendium that assists in allowing the viewer or reader to better understand the information presented. This is often specific to its audience. In this particular case, information is communicated through the covering on selected areas on the map. This includes the total cases, deaths, new cases, new cases per 100, 000 people as well as the display of a 14 day trend in the rises and decreases on covid-19 cases through the use of a dot graph.Users may also make use of a colour coding tool, whereby the reader/viewer can choose to only view particular severity areas of infection. Users may also make use of a colour coding tool, whereby the reader/viewer can choose to only display a certain level of severity within the map only as opposed to displaying each variety of severity upon the map as this may leave to confusion and make it difficult to identify problem areas.Overall, this form of representation and communication allows for easy understanding and legibility, even for limited English speakers. This is due to the use of majority of the information being displayed through visual means. The option at the bottom however, to only highlight particular problem areas can be confusing as there is no heading or label explaining its use; despite the implication of the colours becoming red (which has a common understanding globally of representing intensity and severity. Personally I have no clue what the numbers underneath it indicate, which is a lack in communication strategies.
