                    <P class = "SecRightP"> According to onLi Q’s article, titled: Overview of Data Visualization, she elaborates on and dissects (not surprisingly) on Data Visualization. This being the various illustrations and representations of data via visuals means. This includes and is not limited to: diagrams, charts, trees, tables, scatter plots, maps, waveforms, simulations, volume, pictures etc. This is a sufficient way to embody information in such a way that is more accessible and easily introduced to various individuals due to its easy interpretation. What is particularly helpful with these forms of data representation is the fact that often two different mediums can overlap. This allows for easy interpretation, understanding and analysis even my less skilled individuals within a respective field. Her article equally looks at how our brains in fact interpret visual means of information. This is done via the understandings of pre-attentive processing; this being an individual’s subliminal lodgement of data within one’s surroundings. Her studies however, do not purely look at visual and aesthetic methods of data processing. She elaborates on the lack of involvement within this form of informational processing by its availabilities to the understanding of insight. Despite this, data visualization very clearly reflects on two different ideas; these being its affiliation between aesthetics and serviceableness with regards to the HCI industries.  The aesthetics within HCI has been introduced by Kurosu and Kashimura in 1995; and has been elaborated on and studied comprehensively throughout the years. Their workings provide detailed studies on the significance of well thought out visual representation that is appealing to its viewers. An unappealing form of representation decreases engagement due to a lack of interest. This is a form of virtuosity that has gained interest particularly within the early twenty-first century upon entering a digitally based era. Arguably, as well as through the influence of studies and data, individuals such as Van Wijk have explored how effectiveness within this respective field and informational guidance to be particularly effective; it needs to be sleek, simple, appealing and symmetric.

                        <P class = "SecRightP"> I will be focusing on the respective User Experiences and User Interface with regards to Instagram’s multiplatform application/website. Its interface is simple, sleek and prevents viewers from being overwhelmed by an overly busy screen. This is particularly important when used through a mobile, as features, menus etc. are placed in a smaller and more compact area. In terms of being easily accessible and adaptable for various audiences, it functions very poorly. Even though I have been a consistent user since the year it was released; I often find that I struggle to navigate through various parts of their menus as well as having an easy access to certain features that are consistently released. This is due to the fact that they are trying to be consistent throughout their page with regards to aesthetic appeal through the use of simple icons; however this could be easily combatted y providing a brief tutorial for all new users, as well as by providing a walk through and tutorial whenever a new feature is added. Kidd’s article focuses on various representational outputs; whether through myth, reality, persuasion, visual culture and lastly identity politics. With regards to Instagram, we can view the app as a representation through all of these means. It attempts to create a feel of being able to have an insight into people’s lives, interest, work etc. on a global scale; helping viewers to experience these things through real time such as through live videos. It equally contributes to myth as there is an enormous access to Photoshop as well as camera angles that contribute to creating a certain façade or narrative controlled by the author. Persuasion can be played on through the use of propaganda and also through the creating of aspirational, sometimes unattainable lives or products that may be sold. Visual culture is perhaps the most obvious as there is an abundance to imagery and videos; this is pretty self-explanatory. Lastly, identity politics, this is when a group or people, whether through gender, race, religion etc. are grouped and united by theories of political agendas that they feel oppress them; this can be elaborated on and identified through the abundant sharing of a black fist during the black lives matter movement that represented support for the movement.

                        <P class = "SecRightP"> The design of my website, although quite full as indicated by my wireframes; it is structured for easy legibility and smooth user experience. Kidd looks at various factors in order to comprehensively understand UX and UI. As stated “Representation and reality; representation and myth; representation and visual culture; representation as persuasion; and representation and identity politics.”
                            My website can fall under representation and reality, representation and persuasion and representation of visual culture. My intent of the website is to display my works in order to gain customers; the display of my imagery is showing the reality of my work and essentially what I can do. In doing so, I am attempting to persuade my audience and readers in hiring me and making use of me as a makeup artist. The use of imagery as well at the overall styling and formatting of the website is where visual culture comes into play.
                            I have attempted to make my website appealing to a variety of audiences no matter how advanced they may be technologically. Despite my attempt to create irregularly structured imagery for a more modern appeal that represents my artistic medium, it is easy to navigate through the imagery, even with the option to view all on one page. 
                            I have made use of visual indicators to hyperlinks through the use of buttons and search bars, such as when attempting to go to my Instagram, Facebook etc. through the use of their respective icons. Overall my UX and UI in my opinion is sufficient for my audiences as depending on the viewer, they can choose to view different types of works (bridal, avant-garde, editorial etc.) on different pages as not all of my viewers understand the different styles of work and placing them side to side will confuse the viewer if they are not a part of the industry.

                            <P class = "SecRightP"> Data Visualization refers to the depiction of data via visual means. There are various tools that can be used to do this, ranging from and not limited to: diagrams, pictures, charts etc. Jenny Kidd describes data visualization and how it is represented in such a way that allows us to use it within the new eras of mass media. In order to do so she compares it to older, outdated means of representation. She elaborates on the social, political and cultural significances of representation throughout a large area within the artistic and digital industries. Michael Friendly emphasizes how data history is incredibly large in scale and incredibly difficult to summarize to its full extent. Surprisingly, data visualization historically has produced some phenomenal artistic representations, specifically within the 19th century. Due to a sense of beauty in past forms of this medium, it has created a challenge for modern producers, in order to be able to introduce new and innovative approaches, that are just as effective and beautiful, if not more so than those of the past. By understanding this history, one can also understand how and why this particular medium arose.Clive Thompson on the other hand, elaborates on political motives that have been used throughout history and have had a direct impact on entire nations. His work is more specific within this particular field, as opposed to Kidd and Friendly, who have provided a more general understanding of data visualization. This is particularly impactful as it provides access to a larger variety of readers and allows for easier understanding of political motives and results, for example, a graph showing the inequalities of a wage gap varying amongst races and people of different genders.Overall, they have all made it abundantly clear that historical data pays a pivotal role in understanding today’s necessities of data distribution; especially in order to understand and study the most effective means of reaching a larger audience.

                                <P class = "SecRightP"> Knaflic’s literary work revolves around the deep understanding and breaking down of visual modelling. This refers to the graphic representation of various mediums, including and not limited to items and different structures of importance through the use of digital means and dialect. Visual modelling is an appealing, compact and simplified mean of expressing certain information for various individuals; from experiences scholars to beginners within a field.She attempts to distinguish the best methods with which information can be displayed and for which forms of information. This is done with a focus on simplicity as well as aesthetic appeal that is intended to be easily understood by even the most inexperienced of viewers. This is done through the understandings of graph type, as well as the way in which data has been organized. In order to do this, designers need to have an understanding as to how the eye is lead throughout a particular choice of formulated display.She elaborates on the importance of every visual component implemented; from the choice in colour, structure, width, size, borders etcetera. She also elaborated on the importance of headers, footnotes, labels, lists and essentially, how one summarizes the investigated topic. One needs to understand how to in fact shorten a multitude of information that even an individual with very limited digital dialect can understand what is presented from first glance.She also emphasizes the importance of understanding poor forms of visual modelling as this prevents us from making similar mistakes within our own works; specifically when it comes to understanding our audience and why they have come to look at your visual representation of data. That being said, Knaflic emphasizes how there is in fact, no real “right” way of displaying data, this is influenced by the artist’s style, choice and personal understanding of information and data visualization.Overall, Knaflic assists in the identification of both positive and negative choices within the world of data visualization, and how understanding both of these factors are equally important.

                                    <P class = "SecRightP"> I will be analysing the visual representation of the world map on the website Information is beautiful titled COVID-19 Coronavirus Hotspots as displayed below:This particular form of representational strategies within this particular graph is through the use of a world map. Representational strategies refer to how certain form of information is embodied for the viewer or reader. More specifically, this is the kind of information design is transliterated. The communication strategies can refer to how certain information is conveyed. More specifically it is a type of compendium that assists in allowing the viewer or reader to better understand the information presented. This is often specific to its audience. In this particular case, information is communicated through the covering on selected areas on the map. This includes the total cases, deaths, new cases, new cases per 100, 000 people as well as the display of a 14 day trend in the rises and decreases on covid-19 cases through the use of a dot graph.Users may also make use of a colour coding tool, whereby the reader/viewer can choose to only view particular severity areas of infection. Users may also make use of a colour coding tool, whereby the reader/viewer can choose to only display a certain level of severity within the map only as opposed to displaying each variety of severity upon the map as this may leave to confusion and make it difficult to identify problem areas.Overall, this form of representation and communication allows for easy understanding and legibility, even for limited English speakers. This is due to the use of majority of the information being displayed through visual means. The option at the bottom however, to only highlight particular problem areas can be confusing as there is no heading or label explaining its use; despite the implication of the colours becoming red (which has a common understanding globally of representing intensity and severity. Personally I have no clue what the numbers underneath it indicate, which is a lack in communication strategies.

                                        <P class = "SecRightP"> I have decided to provide hyperlinks to each graph, however I would have liked to display them on one page; however due to the 2 different scripts used, I could not seem to make both function on one page. I made use of both a pie chart and bar graph. 
                                            The bar graph displays the top industries that make use of makeup artists and to what degree. I chose to do this as it allowed viewers to visually see through the use of bars a side by side version of the data as it was relatively simple. The bar graph is arguably the easiest graph in terms of legibility and numbers; therefore I felt it was a great use of representation for various users.
                                            The pie chart displays how many makeup artists there are in the industry dependant on race. The reason that I chose to represent this data in such a way is because I feel that pie and even line charts represents drastic differences in data most efficiently due to the layout. This allows viewers to see the tremendous gap in this artistic industry in terms of race.
                                            I do not feel however that my graphs are the most aesthetically appealing to the viewer; this is due to the lack of animated features and interactivity between the viewer and the graphs. Even a simple animation of each element of the graph displaying one by one through a fading animation would have a better grasp of the viewers’ attention and engagement. This unfortunately makes the viewers less likely to care about the data and actually read and make use of the given information. The data represented is however quite simple and therefore does not over stimulate and overwhelm the viewer, which is perhaps the most appealing part of my chosen forms of data representation.

            Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin wrote an article that elaborates on what exactly the place of interactivity is within data visualization. They suggest that interactivity within this field is in fact lacking in specification. As suggested by the writers: “this confusion is due to a lack of consensual definition” (Dimara & Perin 2020, pg 1).
        </P>
        <p><br>
            Ultimately what they are saying is that this lack of mutual understanding and defining of what in fact is deemed an appropriate form of interactivity in data visualization; allows for creators to create incredibly poor and lacking contributions to information. This results in meaningless interactivity that may play no real role in enhancing the data or necessarily attracting an audience through visual means. An example of this could be the highlighting of information when hovered upon with no other purpose. This would confuse the viewer into thinking that you could in fact click on the information and would make the page appear broken or bugged. It is also incredibly irritating for the viewer when information is not communicated sufficiently. 
        </p>
        <p><br>
            They argue that in order to tackle this dilemma; variously aged visualization researchers need to contribute and settled on a compromised understanding and definition of interactivity within this particular form of representing information. Once researchers and developers have a starting point to work from; it allows for a clearer path of exploration that will not only allow for expression and original work; however it prevents the use and implementation of meaningless, poor and irritating forms of interactivity.

            I will be looking at Coronavirus Riskiest activities as a semiotic device on the Information is Beautiful website. In order to do so we need to understand semiotics. Semiotics are the studies and representations of various symbols, indications etc. through the use of a visual discourse. This allows viewers to easily interpret data, allowing easy interpretation and understanding by its viewers and readers. 
        </P>
        <p><br>
            This particular use of semiotics is not necessarily the easiest for all viewers. It is quite clusters with a variation of circles and texts within these circles. Upon first glance the data appears quite messy and overwhelming due to the lack of structure. This makes it particularly easy to lose track of where you have and haven’t read yet. 
            What is particularly helpful is the use of colour coding in order to express various risk factors and which are in fact more severe than others which is read from a left to right movement. 

        </p>
        <p><br>
            There are side comments indicated on certain circles that allow for viewers to understand that despite these scenarios being placed in varied areas of risk, risk in fact may vary depending on circumstances indicated in these side comments. 
            The colour palette is simple with allows for easy viewing which ultimately results in a greater sense of viewer interaction; however, whether or not this compensates for the randomly and confusingly positioned information is arguable.

        </p>
        <p><br>
            Essentially the interactivity on this page as a semiotic device is arguably mediocre and could have a form of structure whether from a top down organization or left to right where the circles are lined together in some ways.

            I have introduced an interactive line graph that displays the various percentages of education used within the world of makeup artistry. When hovered upon a point in the graph, the percentage and description of the data pops up for ease of the viewer. The graph also is introduced with a small animation whereby the graph organizes itself into place. 
        </p>
        <p><br>
            The graph is incredibly simple to read and allows for easy understanding and interpretation from a variation of readers. I have made the graph read which makes it not as legible against my peach coloured background; I am aiming on introducing that towards my exam submission. 
            As expressed by Dimara and Perin in 2020, “Interaction is fundamental to data visualization, but what “interaction” means in the context of visualization is ambiguous and confusing.” By this they mean that there is no real specification as to what is deemed an appropriate form of interactivity in data visualisation; whether it is for aesthetic means such as an introductory animation or in terms of introducing and expanding on data even further. 
            I have also included an interactive bar graph; however the bars simply highlight when hovered upon. Absolutely nothing happens when clicked on and there is only this aesthetic component; this is perhaps what was meant by Dimara and Perin whereby interactivity can be deemed ambiguous and confusing. 

        </p>
        <p><br>
            In order to combat this and provide a purpose to this bar graph, it could open pages that in fact elaborated on each industry that makes use of makeup artists and for what projects and uses specifically.

            I will be looking at and elaborating on Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg’s Artistic Data Visualization: Beyond Visual Analytics’. As identified by these authors, data visualization has been seen as an investigative means for displaying information and allowing viewers to ultimately interpret information in an easier fashion, and thus allowing them to make sense of certain information that they may not have been able to understand previously. 
        </P>
        <p><br>
            Despite these clear guidelines; it is through modern and digital implementations that data visualization and its guidelines have become somewhat cloudy. This is due to experimentation and the now easy accessibility to creating visual data. This also means that amateurs and inexperienced researchers have the capability to produce their own work and expose it internationally through the internet. 
        </p>
        <p><br>
            This paper provides it readers with guidelines and ultimately what s=is deemed an appropriate form of data visualization I order to create meaningful work that is enjoyed and understood by viewers and readers. 
        </p>
        <p><br>
            They specifically look into the scientific understanding of data visualization and its original uses; that being the using of data visualization as a tool for gaining insight and understanding of specific studies. An example of this would be in Richard Feynman’s quantum theory. Similarly it could be used for understanding DNA and Atoms through the use of a 3D view that is easier to create and interpret through digital means as it can be animated and adjusted unlike a live model. Despite being detrimental to studies and researching new information; it is equally as important in educating youths in already discovered data.

            I will be looking at the Information is Beautiful website for the following analysis. The particular data visualization I will be analysing is the one on 20th Century Death. This particular data is represented within various circles of various sizes. The largest ones show the starting factors of 20th century death, with smaller circles connecting off of it. These smaller circles break down the information into more specific data: such as the amount of people dying from cancer. The large circle expresses how many individuals die from cancer both visually and through text as opposed to the other circles as it is the smallest of the starting circles. This is also represented through colour coding. The smaller circles are different in colour and break off into sections of types of cancer and amounts of deaths due to these various cancers. These are also colour coded and are displayed accordingly through size.

        <p><br>
            This data is easy to read and to navigate through, even when the quality is poor (should I choose not to select the image and open it) and blurry, preventing me from being able to fully understand and read the data. This representation is however proven to be relatively good, as despite this short coming, I know what the data is attempting to represent and how it is doing so. 
        </p>
        <p><br>
            There is however a large amount of data on a small page which forces the viewer to zoom in, in order to view everything properly. This could cause the viewer to lose track of where they are reading as all the shapes are randomly placed as well as in abundance.

            With regards to my interactive data visualization; I was hoping to make the data easily legible by a varied audience. I was hoping to make it informative and relevant. 
            There are many aspects whereby I can improve. I could make the graph larger in order to allow for easy legibility by older audiences or those with poorer sight as I would like to make viewing as convenient as possible. This means that I do not want to force my viewers and readers in having to zoom into the web page in order to see accurately.    
        </P>
        <p><br>
            I am hoping to implement hyperlinks in the near future that expands on the information being looked at; this being the percentages of makeup artists with varying degrees. The hyperlinks could expand on each degree and explain the relevance and advantages of these particular degrees in the field. It could also allow viewers to gain insight into how easily accessible education in fact is.

            According to Dimara and Perin, in their article What is Interaction for Data Visualization? “The notion of interaction has been a challenging concept to define in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).” (Dimara & Perin 2020) Ultimately what this means is that there are no real guidelines as to how we can implement sufficient interactive data visualization for our audience in the best way possible. Unfortunately this can lead to petty and poor attempts in what could potentially be exciting and hugely educational.

                I will be analysing and reflecting on Ethics in Data-Driven Visual Storytelling by Nicholas Diakopoulos. According to this article there are 3 basic principles when it comes to data driven story production. The first being to “Seek truth and report it as fully as possible.” the second being: “Be     transparent.” and the third being to “Engage community as an end, rather than as a means.”
            </P>
            <p><br>
                These 3 guidelines are essentially put into place in order to reaffirm the standards in data visualizations and if followed; it would prevent poorly executed work and information. Essentially he is saying that not only should data be as accurate as possible and thoroughly researched before displayed to the public, it should be done so to its fullest capacity in order to prevent misinterpretation.  It is also important to be honest with the public a.k.a. “transparent”, typing in again with reporting the truth as fully as possible despite personal beliefs and motives. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
                Overall they break down the importance of accuracy and the significant role researches have in society due to the large access to the internet and an incredible abundance of poor information and conspiracy theories. It is our duty to present our viewers with all the information possible and therefore provide them with an aid to make the most educated and thought through decision.
